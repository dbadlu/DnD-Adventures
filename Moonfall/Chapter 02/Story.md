## 📖 Prologue: A Forest That Ticks

_Read aloud to begin_

After defeating the Mirror Mimic in Willowden, Professor Pipwick uses your new magical gear-pendants to teleport you to the edge of the **Whirledwood**, a forest where time... ticks.

> "The Clockwork Grove is ahead. Long ago, druids built magical machines to help the forest grow in sync with the stars. But now, something’s jammed the gears—and time itself is off balance!"

The trees creak rhythmically. Leaves fall upward. A hummingbird zips by, then rewinds. You step onto a cobbled path of interlocking gears that lead deeper into the grove.

---

## 🎭 Scene Setup

You enter a mossy clearing with three towering **mechanical trees**, each with:
- Rotating branches  
- Clicking gears embedded in the bark  
- Crystal runes pulsing blue, yellow, and green  

In the center is a **time pedestal** with a missing gear. Nearby, a twisted **clockwork beetle** lies upside down, twitching.

## ⛩️ Turn to Page 2: Investigating the Clearing

## 📄 Page 2: The Broken Beetle

You hear a faint whirring sound as the beetle twitches. Its eyes blink in Morse code (Rictus helpfully tries to interpret, but it turns out he’s wrong).

You may:
- **Help the beetle up** → Turn to Page 3  
- **Search the pedestal** → Turn to Page 4  
- **Investigate the trees** → Turn to Page 5  

---

## 📄 Page 3: Friendly Fix

The beetle rights itself and blinks gratefully. It skitters to a rock and **pushes out a glowing silver gear**—clearly the one that belongs on the pedestal.

Each player may **gain inspiration** for kindness.

Turn to Page 6.

---

## 📄 Page 4: Pedestal Puzzle

The pedestal socket is gear-shaped, but runes light up in a pattern:
- Blue, Yellow, Green, Blue

A voice whispers:  
> “To turn the grove, align the hearts. Start where time begins.”

Roll Arcana or Insight (DC 11).  
- **Success** → Turn to Page 6  
- **Fail** → Turn to Page 7

---

## 📄 Page 5: Clockwork Trees

The rotating trees seem to “tick” like a clock:
- **Tree 1:** Green and slow (tick... tick...)  
- **Tree 2:** Yellow and fast (tick-tick-tick)  
- **Tree 3:** Blue and steady (tick-tick)

Placing your hand on the **blue tree** makes the pedestal glow slightly.

Return to Page 2 or roll a check at Page 4.

---

## 📄 Page 6: Grove Awakens

You insert the gear, and the pedestal rises. A shimmer pulses through the trees. The beetle chirps—but is cut off as **clockwork monsters emerge** from the trees!

> **Begin combat:** 2x Clockwork Beetles + 1 Gearsprite  
> See monster stat block

After battle, turn to Page 8.

---

## 📄 Page 7: Magical Misfire

The pedestal emits a loud BOING! and zaps the closest player. Take 1 lightning damage and retry from Page 4.

---

## 📄 Page 8: The Path Unwinds

From the pedestal, a new silver path unwinds across the forest floor. Pipwick’s voice crackles from your pendants:

> “Nice job! You restored the rhythm. The next site lies beyond Emberpeak... where things are heating up. Get ready!”

Turn to Chapter 3: *The Howling Halls*

---

## 🧩 Puzzle: Rune Gear Pattern

> _“To turn the grove, align the hearts. Start where time begins.”_

The solution is to touch the blue rune (the steady tree), then follow the pedestal’s color pattern:  
**Blue → Yellow → Green → Blue**

(Hint: Use perception or Arcana to interpret tick speeds)

---

## 🪄 Magic Item: Chronoglass Leaf

**Wondrous Item (1/day)**  
A shimmering leaf made of glass and time magic.

- **Effect:** Freeze time for one object for 1 round (can’t move, drop, or be used)
- Great for stopping traps, attacks, or enemy items
- Recharge: 1 long rest

---

## 🤹 Joke – Pipwick’s Observation

> “I invented a time-traveling sandwich once. It was gone before I even made it!”

Rictus groans. The beetle chirps politely.

---

## ☠️ Rictus in the Grove

If summoned here, roll a Rictus Quirk as usual. Suggested bonus twist:

> **Time Glitch Rictus** – He stutters and repeats his last sentence, then starts talking backward for a round. (“tsop em ni kcab m’I!”)
