## 📖 Prologue: A Gathering of Heroes

_Read aloud to begin_

Welcome to the quiet village of **Willowden**, where the annual **Festival of Moonlight** is usually a time of music, lanterns, and laughter. But this year… strange things have begun to happen.

- Reflections don’t match what’s real.  
- Shadows wiggle when you’re standing still.  
- One villager sneezed and it echoed *backward*.  

In desperation, the eccentric wizard **Professor Pipwick** has summoned three unlikely heroes:

- **Kaelith Sunshadow**, a brooding necromancer haunted by a mysterious past and accompanied by a talking skeleton named Rictus.
- **Elyndra “Moonwhisper” Stellaluna**, an elven rogue with a flute, a gift for illusions, and a habit of sneaking into danger.
- **Tharagon “The Bold” Scalefist**, a Dragonborn warrior who once returned a dragon hatchling to its mother—and hasn't stopped telling the story since.

The party meets for the first time in the village square, where stone paths wind around a central fountain, surrounded by market stalls, a wooden gazebo, and… a strange, silver-framed mirror leaning beside a tree.

## 🎭 The Meeting

Professor Pipwick, in his usual oversized robes and goggles, waves excitedly from the fountain.

> “Oh good! You all came! There’s a mirror here doing *weird things*, and I need smart, magical, or wildly brave people to poke at it!”

He gestures toward the mirror. Behind him, the villagers whisper and watch, clearly unsettled.

## ⛩️ Start in the Village Square (Turn to Page 2)

## 📄 Page 2: The Square

You stand in the center of Willowden Square. The map features:
- A **fountain** surrounded by four lantern posts  
- A **gazebo** (Pipwick’s magical notes are strewn about inside)  
- **Market stalls** in red, green, and blue  
- A **mirror** shimmering next to a tree, gently humming  
- Villagers peeking from behind curtains

You may:
- **Inspect the Mirror** → Turn to Page 3  
- **Talk to the Villagers** → Turn to Page 4  
- **Look for Magical Disturbances** → Roll Arcana (DC 10)  
  - **Success:** Turn to Page 5  
  - **Fail:** Turn to Page 6

---

## 📄 Page 3: The Mirror

As you touch the mirror, it **ripples like water**… then suddenly opens and tries to bite you!

It’s a **Mirror Mimic**!

> **Begin combat** using the monster sheet: *Mirror Mimic*  
> Rictus joins the fight! Roll for initiative and give him a resurrection quirk if he was recently re-summoned.

After the battle, turn to Page 7.

---

## 📄 Page 4: Talking to Villagers

- An old woman named **Miss Bramble** says,  
  > “The mirror winked at me, I swear!”
- A little girl named **Nessa** whispers,  
  > “It showed me… *me*, but backwards.”

You gain clues about the mimic’s nature. Add **+2 to your next Perception or Arcana check**.

Return to Page 2 and choose again.

---

## 📄 Page 5: Magical Insight

You sense strong illusion magic—clever and mischief-driven. The mirror isn’t just enchanted; it’s alive.

You may:
- **Tap it gently** → Turn to Page 8  
- **Touch it boldly** → Turn to Page 3 (combat)

---

## 📄 Page 6: Magical Confusion

You detect magic, but misinterpret it. A nearby stall explodes in magical confetti. You take 1 damage.  
> (Kaelith may ignore this due to necrotic shielding. Rictus laughs dramatically.)

Return to Page 2.

---

## 📄 Page 7: After the Battle

As the mimic is defeated, it shatters into magical shards. A soft glow reveals:

> **You find a magic item: [Moonstone Marble]**

Pipwick rushes over, breathless.

> “That wasn’t just an illusion—that was a *test*! Something or *someone* sent that mimic to this village. I fear it’s only the beginning...”

Turn to Page 9.

---

## 📄 Page 8: The Gentle Touch

The mirror shows a swirling riddle written in silver flame:

> _“I fly forever, rest never,  
> I flicker with fire, but burn no feather.  
> What am I?”_

> **Answer:** A star  
> **Clue for younger players:** “You see it at night, high above. It sparkles, but it’s not fire.”

If correct, turn to Page 7.  
If incorrect, turn to Page 3 (combat).

---

## 📄 Page 9: The Journey Begins

Pipwick hands you a scroll and adjusts his goggles.

> “There’s a disturbance spreading across the land. The next anomaly lies in a strange forest where trees tick like clocks. If you're willing, I can teleport you there.”

Do the players agree?

> **If yes…** prepare to begin Chapter 2: *The Clockwork Grove*

## 🎲 Rictus Resurrection Quirks (Roll 1d8)

Every time Rictus is re-summoned, roll for a new weird behavior:

1. **Insists he’s seen the future**, but speaks in vague riddles  
2. **Follows Moonwhisper’s orders** for 1 turn  
3. **Thinks he’s invisible** and narrates all his sneaking  
4. **Terrified of chickens** and refuses to fight if one’s nearby  
5. **Wears a monocle** and quotes fake literature  
6. **Mistakes reflections for other skeletons**  
7. **Flaps his arms like a bird** when running  
8. **Calls Tharagon “Captain Scales”** and salutes in combat

---

## 🤹 Pipwick’s Joke (Bonus Flavor)

> “What do you get when you cast *Invisibility* on a chicken?”  
> _“Fowl play!”_

(He laughs too hard. Rictus groans in pain.)
