## Chapter 4.5: The Cube Beneath the Crag (Side Quest)
*If the heroes trigger too much chaos in Emberpeak, they get rerouted into slime...*

### 📖 Prologue: Slippery Detour
_Read aloud to begin._

As the last echoes of Emberkin’s roar fade, the party’s pendants begin to spark. Instead of teleporting forward, a **fizzle of magic** swirls around them — and they fall **straight down** through a collapsing floor.

You land in a sticky, dark cavern lit by bioluminescent mushrooms. Everything smells like moldy lemon custard.

A green rune glows behind you.

> "Magical reroute," mutters Rictus, "Very inconvenient. And wet."

### 📄 Page 2: The Ooze Tunnel
You slide into a wider cavern filled with:
- A shimmering **gel wall** blocking one exit  
- A **puzzle pedestal** shaped like a cube  
- The echoing sound of **wet squelching** nearby  

You may:
- **Inspect the gel wall** → Turn to Page 3  
- **Examine the pedestal puzzle** → Turn to Page 4  
- **Look around cautiously** → Perception DC 12

### 📄 Page 3: Gel Wall
The translucent wall jiggles when poked. A coin tossed into it slowly dissolves.

Only magic or an exact pulse will open it safely.

### 📄 Page 4: The Puzzle Pedestal
A riddle is etched on the surface:

> _“I have no face, yet devour all.  
> I take no breath, yet I move.  
> I am unseen — until you’re inside me.”_

(Answer: **Gelatinous Cube**)

- Correct → the pedestal clicks → Turn to Page 7  
- Incorrect → the room begins to vibrate → Turn to Page 6

### 📄 Page 5: Cube Ambush Avoided
You hear a faint bubbling sound and dodge aside just as a **Gelatinous Cube** oozes from the ceiling!

### 📄 Page 6: Surprise Cube Attack!
With a wet plop, a **Gelatinous Cube** drops from the ceiling onto the closest character.
