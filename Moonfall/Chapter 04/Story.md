## 📖 Prologue: Ember Calls

_Read aloud to begin_

After banishing the Trickster Specter in the Howling Halls, your gear-pendants shimmer again. Pipwick’s voice echoes faintly:

> “The final arc before the Moonfall... leads to **Emberpeak**. Beware the flames — and those who control them.”

You appear on a rocky cliff beneath a volcanic mountain. Lava bubbles deep below. A distant roar echoes up through tunnels carved into the stone.

A carved sign reads:  
> **“Here Sleeps the Emberkin Flame.”**

---

## 🎭 Scene Setup

You descend into a volcanic cavern lit by glowing crystals and trickling lava.

The party enters a large chamber with:
- A **circular lava moat**
- Four **dragon statues**, each missing a piece
- A sealed **obsidian gate** with glowing red glyphs
- Scraps of parchment showing **Draconic runes**

## 📄 Page 2: The Puzzle Chamber

Each statue is missing a key object:  
1. A **flame orb**  
2. A **scale fragment**  
3. A **tooth-shaped crystal**  
4. A **claw relic**

A riddle is etched above:

> _"Four gifts of dragon flame lost to time,  
> Returned in kind shall lift the line.  
> One burns, one guards, one bites, one holds —  
> Restore their gifts and pass the folds."_

## 📄 Page 4: Dragon Shrine (Right Tunnel)

A dusty altar holds a black scale and a swirling **flame orb** inside a magical field.

To retrieve it, someone must pass an **Arcana or Insight check (DC 12)**  
- **Success**: Gain **Flame Orb**  
- **Fail**: Fire lash triggers → take 1d6 fire damage

Return to Page 2.

Dexterity check (DC 13)  
- **Success**: Find the **Tooth Crystal** near a magma vent  
- **Fail**: Take 2 fire damage and lose next action turn

Return to Page 2.

## 📄 Page 6: The Obsidian Gate

When all 4 relics are placed, the statues glow and the gate opens.

A **low growl echoes** — and a fiery wyrmling bursts from molten rock behind the altar!

> Begin boss battle: **Emberkin Wyrmling**  
> See monster stats

After battle, turn to Page 7.

---

## 📄 Page 7: The Path Forward

As the dragon fades into mist, a moonbeam breaks through the cave ceiling.

You gain:  
- 🪄 **Scale of Emberkin** (magic item)  
- 📜 A glowing map fragment to the final location

Before teleporting, Pipwick’s voice returns:

> “You did it! Wait—hold on. Something’s… blocking the signal. It’s sticky. And jiggling?”

**If the players took more than 10 damage combined** OR **failed the statue puzzle**, Pipwick’s magic fizzles and diverts you into a strange side path…

> 📘 Continue to Side Quest: *The Cube Beneath the Crag*  
> Otherwise, turn to Chapter 5

## 🤹 Joke – Ember Humor

Rictus, covered in soot, mutters:

> “Next time someone says ‘it’s just a hot spring,’ I’m staying in the grave.”

---

## ☠️ Rictus in Emberpeak

If summoned here, roll a quirk. Suggested twist:

> **Believes he is a dragon** and tries to roar. It comes out as a clacking jaw and some steam from a nearby vent.
