## 📖 Prologue: Echoes in the Dark

_Read aloud to begin_

After restoring the Clockwork Grove, Professor Pipwick appears once more via magical hologram.

> “Splendid work! Now… you’re off to the **Howling Halls** — an old ruin beneath a forgotten temple. It’s haunted, yes, but delightfully so. Expect riddles, illusions, echoing voices, and floating candles. Oh, and don’t trust any doors that speak to you. Cheers!”

Your magical pendants shimmer and teleport you to a cold stone hallway. The air smells of dust, lavender, and… stale cheese?

Ahead, you hear a ghostly giggle and a door creaking shut on its own.

---

## 🎭 Scene Setup

You stand at the entrance to a crumbling underground temple. There are:
- Three large **stone doors** — each with a glowing symbol: eye 👁️, flame 🔥, and feather 🪶  
- A **fountain filled with ghostly mist**  
- Floating candles hovering above pews  
- The faint sound of music playing… backward?

## 📄 Page 2: The Hall of Three Doors

The three doors stand silent and waiting. A whisper speaks from the misty fountain:

> “To walk the path, know the past. Echoes guide, but answers last.”

You may:
- **Open the Eye Door 👁️** → Turn to Page 3  
- **Open the Flame Door 🔥** → Turn to Page 4  
- **Open the Feather Door 🪶** → Turn to Page 5  
- **Investigate the Fountain** → Arcana or Insight DC 11 → Success = Page 6, Fail = Page 7

---

## 📄 Page 3: Door of Memory (Eye 👁️)

You enter a shadowy room filled with floating images from each character’s memories.

Players must each recall (or invent) a moment from their past. Then choose:
- One memory to let go of (gain a temporary +2 bonus to a roll this session)  
- One to protect (gain inspiration)

Turn to Page 6.

## 📄 Page 4: Door of Fire (🔥)

Flames flicker in mid-air, spelling out a riddle:

> _“I am not alive, yet I grow.  
> I don’t have lungs, yet I need air.  
> What am I?”_

**Answer:** _Fire_  
Correct → Turn to Page 6  
Incorrect → Take 1 fire damage, then retry or return to Page 2

---

## 📄 Page 5: Door of Whispers (Feather 🪶)

This room contains ghostly whispers arguing about the best dessert. One ghost says Moonwhisper looks familiar.

If Elyndra speaks, they recognize her as:
> “The girl from the silver forest… the one who played under moonlight.”

She gains a **Moonlit Blessing**: +1 to her next spell or stealth check.

The ghosts then fade into mist and leave a silver key behind. Turn to Page 6.

---

## 📄 Page 6: The Hall Opens

With the correct answer, memory, or blessing, the center of the floor opens. A staircase leads down into a glowing moonlit chamber where a ghostly figure floats — humming and upside-down.

> **Begin combat:** 1x Trickster Specter + 2x Illusion Wisps  
> See monster stats

After battle, turn to Page 8.

## 📄 Page 7: Magical Backfire

A false whisper leads you to touch the wrong rune. You briefly swap voices with Rictus. Everyone laughs. No damage — just embarrassment.  
Return to Page 2.

---

## 📄 Page 8: Whisper's End

The ghost, upon being defeated, smiles and fades, leaving behind:

- **Magic Item: Pendant of Echoes**
- A moon rune carved into the wall
- A short verse:

> _“The Emberpeak calls, the dragon flame sleeps,  
> But only the bold can descend where it weeps.”_

You feel the pendants vibrate as the path to **Chapter 4: The Emberpeak Descent** opens.

## 🧩 Puzzle Riddle

> _“I am not alive, yet I grow. I don’t have lungs, yet I need air. What am I?”_  
**Answer:** Fire

---

## 🪄 Magic Item: Pendant of Echoes

**Type:** Wondrous Item (1/day)  
**Effect:** After failing a skill check, whisper to the pendant to reroll  
**Fluff:** Glows softly with ghostlight and hums lullabies when worn  
**Recharge:** Long rest

---

## 🤹 Joke – Haunted Humor

> Rictus whispers: “Why did the ghost go to the party?  
> To lift everyone's *spirits*…”

One of the ghosts groans and vanishes in protest.

---

## ☠️ Rictus in the Halls

If summoned here, roll a quirk. Suggested twist:
> **Rictus becomes overly dramatic**, calling himself “The Phantom of the Bones” and trying to narrate the scene like a tragic play.
