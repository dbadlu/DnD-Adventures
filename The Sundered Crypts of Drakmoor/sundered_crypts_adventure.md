**Subtitle:** "A Dungeons & Dragons Adventure for 2 Players"  

**Scene Description:** A dramatic scene showing a tiefling sorcerer with horns and a skeletal companion standing beside a bronze-scaled dragonborn fighter at the entrance to ancient stone crypts. The tiefling holds a necromantic staff crackling with dark energy, while the dragonborn grips a massive greataxe.

## How to Play This Adventure

**DM-less Mechanics:**
- **Decision Making:** Discuss choices together, but the character most suited to the situation makes the final call
- **Skill Checks:** Roll d20 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus (if proficient). Compare to DC.
- **Combat:** Use standard D&D 5e combat rules. Roll initiative, take turns in order.
- **Advantage/Disadvantage:** Explained in each relevant section. Roll twice, take higher (advantage) or lower (disadvantage).

**When Things Go Wrong:**
- **Failed Skill Checks:** Follow the consequences listed in each section
- **Character Death:** Use death saving throws. If a character dies, they can be revived with magic or the survivor continues alone
- **Stuck on a Puzzle:** If you're completely stuck, allow an Intelligence check DC 15 to get a hint

**Party Coordination:**
- **Kaelith** should handle: Arcana, Investigation, Deception, Intimidation, anything involving undead
- **Tharagon** should handle: Athletics, Intimidation, Religion, anything involving combat or dragons
- **Either Character** can handle: Perception, Persuasion, general exploration

**Splitting the Party:**
- **In Chapter 2:** If you split up to explore different passages, each character faces their chosen encounter alone
- **Rictus:** Always stays with Kaelith unless specifically commanded otherwise
- **Rejoining:** All paths in Chapter 2 converge at Section 2.4, so splitting up is temporary

**Important Notes:**
- Keep track of spell slots, HP, and other resources throughout the adventure
- Short rests take 1 hour, long rests take 8 hours (may not always be safe to take)
- When in doubt about a rule, favor the more dramatic or challenging interpretation

## Rest and Resource Management

**Safe Rest Locations:**
- **Thornwick Village (Chapter 1):** Safe for long rest, but time pressure exists
- **Entry Chamber (Section 2.0):** Safe for short rest only - 1 in 6 chance of wandering monster on long rest
- **Convergence Chamber (Section 2.4):** Safe for short rest after clearing all three passages
- **After Vorthak's Defeat:** Safe for long rest

**Healing Options:**
- **Short Rest:** Spend Hit Dice to recover HP (Kaelith: 1d6+1, Tharagon: 1d10+2)
- **Kaelith's Spells:** No healing spells known, focus on prevention with Shield and Mage Armor
- **Tharagon's Second Wind:** Regain 1d10+1 HP once per short or long rest
- **Found Items:** Healing potions and other recovery items throughout adventure

**Spell Slot Recovery:**
- **Short Rest:** No spell slot recovery for Sorcerers at this level
- **Long Rest:** All spell slots return (Kaelith gets 3 first-level slots back)

## Introduction

> Three days ago, the mountain village of Thornwick fell silent. No smoke rises from chimneys, no travelers emerge from the valley pass. The last merchant to escape spoke of "shadows that walk" and "the dead dragon's curse awakening." 
> 
> You—an unlikely pair bound by circumstance—stand at the weathered stone bridge leading into Thornwick. Kaelith's skeletal companion Rictus rattles softly in anticipation, while Tharagon's bronze-scaled fist clenches around his greataxe. Whatever darkness has consumed this place, it ends today.

**Your Mission:** Investigate Thornwick's silence and stop whatever ancient evil has awakened.

# Chapter 1: The Silent Village
*Section 1.0 - Village Investigation*

> As you cross the bridge, an unnatural chill grips the air despite the afternoon sun. Thornwick's buildings stand intact but eerily empty—doors hang open, meals sit half-eaten on tables, but not a soul stirs. At the village center, a massive crater mars the cobblestones, and from its depths, ancient stone stairs descend into darkness.

**Immediate Observations:**
- 23 villagers vanished without signs of struggle
- The crater appeared exactly 3 days ago
- Strange blue runes glow faintly around the crater's edge
- Rictus becomes agitated near the crater, bones rattling loudly

### Section 1.1 - Examine the Crater and Runes
*If players choose Option A*

**Skill Checks Required:**
- **Arcana DC 12:** Identify the runes as ancient draconic binding magic
- **Investigation DC 10:** Notice the crater was created from below, not from impact
- **Kaelith Advantage:** Necromancy focus gives advantage on detecting undead magic

**Discoveries:**
- The runes are a containment seal, now broken
- Something powerful was imprisoned here for centuries

- **Find:** Healing Potion, 50 GP, Holy Symbol

*Go to Section 1.5 after searching*

### Section 1.3 - Descend Immediately 
*If players choose Option C*

> Tharagon's bold nature takes charge. "Whatever lurks below won't expect a direct assault!" The stairs descend 30 feet into worked stone corridors.

**Immediate Encounter:** 2 Shadow Sprites (see Appendix A) attack as soon as you reach the bottom of the stairs.

**Combat Notes:**
- Shadow Sprites have advantage due to dim lighting
- No preparation bonuses for Chapter 2 encounters
- Tharagon gains Inspiration for bold leadership (advantage on next ability check)

*Go to Section 1.5*

### Section 1.5 - The Descent Begins

*Proceed to Chapter 2*

---

# Chapter 2: The Sundered Halls

*Proceed to Chapter 3*

---

# Chapter 3: The Dracolich's Prison
*Section 3.0 - The Heart of Darkness*

> Beyond the door lies a cathedral-like chamber with a 40-foot ceiling. Chains of pure silver hang broken from the walls, and in the center, a massive skeletal dragon form lies partially assembled. Dark energy swirls around the bones as an ancient voice echoes: "Mortals... you have arrived just in time to witness my return!"

### Section 3.1 - The Villain Revealed

**Vorthak the Eternal** speaks:
> "For 300 years I have gathered strength in this prison. The village above provided excellent... materials. Soon my form will be complete, and I shall reclaim my dominion over these mountains!"

**Information Revealed:**
- Vorthak is a dracolich, an undead dragon of immense power
- He has been using the villagers' life force to reconstruct his body
- The binding was weakened by recent magical storms
- He needs one more day to complete his resurrection

### Section 3.2 - Tactical Decisions

Players must choose their approach:

**A) Direct Assault** - Go to Section 3.3
**B) Attempt to Restore the Binding** - Go to Section 3.4  
**C) Rescue the Villagers First** - Go to Section 3.5
**D) Negotiate/Deceive** - Go to Section 3.6

### Section 3.3 - Direct Combat
*If players choose immediate attack*

**Combat Encounter:** Vorthak (Weakened Form) + 2 Skeletal Guardians
- **Terrain:** Broken chains provide cover, raised platform in center
- **Special:** Vorthak gains 1 HP per turn (regeneration)
- **Victory Condition:** Reduce Vorthak to 0 HP

**Tactical Notes:**
- Tharagon's lightning breath deals double damage
- Kaelith can disrupt regeneration with necromancy spells
- Rictus can provide flanking support

*Victory leads to Section 3.7*

### Section 3.4 - Restore the Binding
*Magical solution requiring teamwork*

**Skill Checks Required:**
- **Kaelith - Arcana DC 15:** Channel necromantic energy to reverse the spell
- **Tharagon - Religion DC 13:** Invoke draconic honor to strengthen binding
- **Combined - Constitution DC 14:** Resist Vorthak's mental assault

**Consequences of Success:**
- Vorthak is re-imprisoned for another century
- Villagers are freed but permanently aged by the ordeal
- Both characters gain permanent +1 to their primary stat

**Consequences of Failure:**
- Binding partially restored but unstable (will break again in 1d4 years)
- Vorthak retains some power and must be fought
- Go to Section 3.3 but Vorthak starts combat with maximum HP and players have disadvantage on initiative rolls

*Success leads to Section 3.8*

### Section 3.5 - Rescue Mission
*Prioritizing the innocent*

> In alcoves around the chamber, you spot the villagers trapped in crystalline cocoons, their life force slowly draining.

**Skill Checks Required:**
- **Investigation DC 12:** Find the cocoon release mechanism
- **Medicine DC 11:** Stabilize freed villagers
- **Kaelith Special:** Necromancy can restore some drained life force

**Encounter:** While rescuing villagers, Vorthak sends 4 Corrupted Villagers (see Appendix A) to stop you.

**Combat Notes:**
- Corrupted Villagers emerge from 4 different cocoons
- They attack mindlessly, focusing on stopping the rescue
- Freed villagers cower and cannot help in combat
- Combat ends if all Corrupted Villagers are defeated or if players retreat

**Results:**
- Save 20 of 23 villagers
- Villagers provide assistance in final battle
- Moral victory bonus: Inspiration for both characters

*Proceed to Section 3.3 with villager support*

### Section 3.6 - Negotiation Attempt
*Risky but potentially rewarding*

**Skill Checks Required:**
- **Kaelith - Deception DC 16:** Convince Vorthak you wish to serve him
- **Tharagon - Intimidation DC 15:** Challenge Vorthak's honor as a dragon
- **Alternative:** Persuasion DC 18 for genuine negotiation

**Possible Outcomes:**
- **Success:** Gain surprise round in inevitable combat
- **Failure:** Vorthak attacks with advantage
- **Critical Success (Nat 20):** Vorthak reveals his phylactery location

*All paths eventually lead to combat*

### Section 3.7 - Victory Through Combat
*Direct confrontation resolution*

> Vorthak's skeletal form crumbles with a final roar of defiance. The dark energy dissipates, and the chamber's oppressive atmosphere lifts. The villagers begin to stir as the dracolich's hold over them breaks.

**Rewards:**
- 1200 XP split between characters
- **Vorthak's Hoard:** 500 GP, gems worth 200 GP
- **Dracolich Skull Fragment** (powerful crafting material)

*Go to Section 4.0*

### Section 3.8 - Victory Through Binding

**Rewards:**
- 1500 XP split between characters (bonus for clever solution)
- **Ancient Binding Knowledge** (spell scroll of powerful magic)

# Chapter 4: The Return to Light
