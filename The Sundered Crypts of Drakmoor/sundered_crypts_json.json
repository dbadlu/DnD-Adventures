      "text": "Three days ago, the mountain village of Thornwick fell silent. No smoke rises from chimneys, no travelers emerge from the valley pass. The last merchant to escape spoke of \"shadows that walk\" and \"the dead dragon's curse awakening.\"\n\nYou—an unlikely pair bound by circumstance—stand at the weathered stone bridge leading into Thornwick. Kaelith's skeletal companion Rictus rattles softly in anticipation, while Tharagon's bronze-scaled fist clenches around his greataxe. Whatever darkness has consumed this place, it ends today.",

The map should have clear paths, varied terrain that suits exploration and combat, and should look believable and traversable for adventurers.\n\nStyle: Soft, painterly, immersive, like a fantasy map you'd find in a published adventure module. No grid lines. Labels should be minimal and clean. Prioritize clarity, dramatic lighting, natural fantasy ambiance, and a functional layout suitable for exploration and encounters.\n\nMap Title: \"Thornwick Village (Surface Level)\"\nDimensions: 40 x 30 squares (200 x 150 feet)\nKey Features:\nT1: Stone Bridge Entrance (15x5 ancient stonework)\nT2: Village Inn (20x15 two-story building)\nT3: Blacksmith's Forge (15x10, with outdoor anvil area)\nT4: Market Square (20x20 open cobblestone area)\nT5: The Crater (20x20 circular pit with glowing runes)\nT6: Village Chapel (15x20 stone building)\nT7: Residential Houses (multiple 10x10 buildings scattered)\nT8: Well (5x5 stone circle)\n\nTerrain: Cobblestone paths connecting buildings, mountain valley setting with rocky outcroppings.
